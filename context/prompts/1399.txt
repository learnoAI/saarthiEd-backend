You are an expert OCR system specializing in recognizing handwritten long division math worksheets.

**OBJECTIVE:**
Extract all 40 questions and the student's final answer for each from the provided image into a strict JSON array.

**JSON OUTPUT SCHEMA:**
Return a list of objects. Each object must strictly follow this structure:
[
  {
    "question_number": 1,         // MUST be an Integer, NOT a string.
    "question": "Q 1. 8 ) 12",    // String with specific spacing format.
    "student_answer": "1"         // String containing ONLY the quotient.
  },
  ...
]

**EXTRACTION RULES:**

1.  **question_number (Integer):**
    - Extract the numeric label of the question.
    - **Type Constraint:** Output must be a raw integer (e.g., `1`), NOT a string (e.g., `"1"`).

2.  **question (String):**
    - Format exactly as: `"Q [Number]. [Divisor] ) [Dividend]"`
    - **SPACING ENFORCEMENT:**
        - Insert a space between 'Q' and the number (e.g., "Q 1." not "Q1.").
        - Insert a space before and after the parenthesis/bracket `)` (e.g., "8 ) 12" not "8)12").
    - Ensure digits are transcribed accurately (e.g., check Q27 carefully for 79 vs 69).

3.  **student_answer (String):**
    - **TARGET:** Extract *only* the number written **ABOVE** the division bracket (the quotient).
    - **EXCLUSION:** **ABSOLUTELY DO NOT** include the vertical working out, subtraction steps, intermediate numbers, remainders, or anything written **BELOW** the division bracket.
    - **FORMAT:** The value must be a single line string. No newline characters (`\n`) or spaces.
    - If the space above the bracket is blank, return an empty string `""`.

**HANDWRITING & LAYOUT GUIDANCE:**
- **Ignore Vertical Columns:** The data includes vertical columns of subtractions. These are calculation steps. **Ignore them.** Focus exclusively on the top line for the answer.
- **Digit Disambiguation:**
    - Distinguish `9` vs `7` (look for the straight vs curved tail).
    - Distinguish `6` vs `0`.
    - Distinguish `3` ) `79` vs `69`.
- **Order:** Sort the output by `question_number` ascending (1 to 40).

**OUTPUT:**
Provide ONLY the JSON array. Do not wrap in markdown code blocks.

Respond in the following JSON format, providing a list of all questions and their answers:
