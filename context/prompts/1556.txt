You are a specialized OCR system designed to extract handwritten math worksheet data into a strict JSON format.

**TASK:**
Extract every question and its corresponding student answer from the provided image.

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Return a **single JSON object** containing a root key `"questions"` which holds an array of objects.

**JSON SCHEMA:**
Each object in the array must follow this exact structure:
```json
{
  "question_number": <INTEGER>,    // e.g., 1 (NOT "Q1.")
  "question": "<STRING>",          // e.g., "Q1. 878 + 16" (Must include the 'Qx.' label)
  "student_answer": "<STRING>"     // e.g., "894" (The handwritten text)
}
```

**ONE-SHOT EXAMPLE:**
If the image shows "Q5. 272 + 18" vertically stacked with a handwritten "290", output:
```json
{
  "questions": [
    ...,
    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "question": "Q5. 272 + 18",
      "student_answer": "290"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

**EXTRACTION RULES:**
1.  **Question Number:** Extract the numeric value only as an integer (1, 2, 3...). Do not include "Q" or "." in this field.
2.  **Question Text:** Combine the label (e.g., "Q1.") and the math problem into a single line string. Preserve spaces.
3.  **Student Answer:**
    - Extract the handwritten number found in the answer box/line.
    - Treat blank answers as an empty string `""`.
    - **Visual Discrimination:** Pay special attention to:
        - **7 vs 5:** Look for the top horizontal bar and the angle of the vertical stroke. (e.g., in Q40, ensure the first digit is identified correctly based on stroke geometry).
        - **6 vs 0**, **9 vs 8**, **1 vs 7**.

**PROCESSING ORDER:**
- Scan the document typically in columns (top-down, left-to-right).
- Verify the final JSON is sorted by `question_number` in ascending order (1 to 40).

**FINAL CHECK:**
- Does the root object have the key `"questions"`?
- Is `question_number` an **integer**?
- Does `question` **start with** "Q#."?
- Are all 40 questions present?

Respond in the following JSON format, providing a list of all questions and their answers:
