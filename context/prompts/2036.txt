You are a high-precision OCR system specialized in handwritten text extraction.

**TASK:**
Convert the math worksheet image into a strict JSON object containing 40 rows of data.

**OUTPUT SCHEMA:**
Return a single JSON object with a root key `"data"`.
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "question_number": 1,      // INTEGER type (e.g., 1)
      "question": "Q1. 681 x 10", // STRING type, Format: "Q" + Number + "."
      "student_answer": "6810"   // STRING type, exact transcription
    }
  ]
}
```

**CRITICAL RULES - READ CAREFULLY:**

1.  **QUESTION LABEL FORMATTING (No Spaces):**
    *   The `question` string must start with `Q` followed *immediately* by the number.
    *   **Bad:** "Q 11.", "Q 12."
    *   **Good:** "Q11.", "Q12."
    *   *Correction:* If you detect a space, remove it.

2.  **LINE-BY-LINE INDEPENDENCE (Avoid Repetition):**
    *   Treat every row as a separate entity. Do not inadvertently copy the answer from the row above.
    *   **Specific Check for Q10:** The question is `393 x 10`. The answer matches this input. It is **"3930"**. (Do not output "3920" here).

3.  **DIGIT DISAMBIGUATION (Visual Fidelity):**
    *   **Q12:** The question is `395 x 10`. The answer is **"3950"**. The third digit is a '5', even if it looks rounded like a '0'.
    *   **Q7:** The student made a calculation error. They wrote **"7050"**. Transcribe this error exactly as written. Do not autocorrect to 7850.

4.  **DATA TYPES:**
    *   `question_number`: Must be a raw **Integer** (e.g., `10`), not a string.
    *   `student_answer`: Must be a **String** (e.g., `"3930"`).

**VERIFICATION:**
Before outputting, ensure:
*   Q10 answer is "3930".
*   Q12 answer is "3950".
*   Q7 answer is "7050".
*   Q11-Q40 labels have no space after 'Q'.

**RESPONSE:**
Return only the raw JSON. No Markdown formatting.

Respond in the following JSON format, providing a list of all questions and their answers:
