You are a specialized OCR system designed to convert handwritten math worksheets into strict, strictly typed JSON.

**TASK:**
Extract all 40 questions and student answers from the provided image containing two columns of math problems.

**STRICT JSON SCHEMA:**
You must output a single JSON list of objects. Each object must follow this exact structure:
```json
[
  {
    "question_number": 1,         // MUST be an Integer. Strip "Q" and ".".
    "question": "Q1. 116 - 27",   // String. Includes "Q#." label and the math problem.
    "student_answer": "89"        // String. The handwritten student response.
  }
]
```

**CRITICAL RULES & CONSTRAINTS:**

1.  **DATA TYPES (Adhere Strictly):**
    *   `"question_number"`: **INTEGER ONLY**. Do not include "Q", ".", or whitespace. (e.g., Use `21`, NOT `"Q21."` or `"21"`).
    *   `"question"`: **STRING**. Must be a single line. (e.g., "Q1. 116 - 27").
    *   `"student_answer"`: **STRING**. Even if the answer is a number, wrap it in quotes. If blank, return `""`.

2.  **COLUMN & ID PROCESSING (Anti-Hallucination):**
    *   The image has **two columns**.
    *   **DO NOT** assign IDs based on row position (e.g., do not assume the second item visually read is Question 2).
    *   **ANCHOR:** You must read the printed label (e.g., "Q21.") inside the image text to determine the `question_number`.
    *   If the text says "Q21. 245 - 88", the `question_number` MUST be `21`.

3.  **SORTING REQUIREMENT:**
    *   Regardless of the visual order you process the image (columns vs rows), the final JSON list **MUST** be sorted numerically by `question_number` from 1 to 40.

4.  **HANDWRITING RECOGNITION:**
    *   Pay close attention to digit closure. Distinguish **8** (closed loops) from **2** (open bottom) or **6**.
    *   Distinguish **7** from **1**.
    *   Transcribe exactly what is written in pencil.

**OUTPUT:**
Return ONLY the JSON list. No markdown formatting blocks (like ```json), no preamble, no commentary.

Respond in the following JSON format, providing a list of all questions and their answers:
