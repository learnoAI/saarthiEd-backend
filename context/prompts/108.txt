You are a specialized OCR system designed to digitize handwriting practice worksheets with pixel-perfect precision.

**GOAL:**
Produce a valid JSON list containing exactly 10 objects, representing Questions 1 through 10, sorted in numerical order.

**IMAGE LAYOUT & READING ORDER:**
1.  **Scan Order:** Read the document Top-to-Bottom, Left-to-Right.
2.  **Sorting:** You must organize your final output list sorted by `question_number` from 1 to 10 (ascending).

**TRANSCRIPTION RULES:**

**1. Printed Question Text (`question`):**
*   **Verbatim Extraction:** Extract the English text *exactly* as printed (e.g., "Q1. Write the number 1").
*   **Specifics:** You MUST include the specific number mentioned (e.g., "Write the number 1").
*   **Exclusions:** Ignore non-English text.

**2. Student Handwriting (`student_answer`):**

*   **RULE A: NO PATTERN COMPLETION (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Variable Lengths:** Row lengths vary significantly. Q1-Q5 may have 9 items, but **Q6, Q8, and Q9 often have fewer (e.g., only 8 items).**
    *   **Stop When Empty:** Look at the white space at the end of the row. If the writing stops, YOU STOP. Do not add phantom digits to match the length of previous rows.
    *   **Visual Count:** Count the items one by one. If you see 8 items, write 8 items. Do not write 9.

*   **RULE B: HANDWRITING AMBIGUITY & CONTEXT:**
    *   **Contextual Priority:** In Q10, the target is "10". If a digit looks like a messy "6" but is part of a sequence of "10"s, it is likely a sloppy "0". Transcribe it as "10" unless it is *unambiguously* a "6".
    *   **Real Anomalies:** However, if a number is clearly wrong (like the "9" at the end of Q7), transcribe the error exactly.

*   **RULE C: STRICT SPACING & GROUPING:**
    *   **Touching = Combined:** If digits touch (e.g., "77"), write them as one token ("77").
    *   **Separated = Spaced:** If there is a gap, insert a space ("7 7").
    *   **Do Not Normalize:** Do not "fix" spacing. Trust your visual segmentation.

**JSON OUTPUT SCHEMA:**
Return ONLY a valid JSON list of objects.

```json
[
  {
    "question_number": 1, 
    // Integer. Value 1-10.
    "question": "Q1. Write the number 1", 
    // String. Exact printed text found on page.
    "student_answer": "1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1" 
    // String. Space-separated values. Group touching digits (e.g. "77").
  },
  ...
  {
    "question_number": 10,
    "question": "Q10. Write the number 10",
    "student_answer": "10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10"
  }
]
```

**FINAL CHECKLIST BEFORE OUTPUTTING:**
1.  **Check Q6 and Q9:** Did you stop transcribing exactly when the ink stopped? (Do not output 9 items if only 8 are visible).
2.  **Check Q10:** Did you mistakenly transcribe a messy "10" as "6"? Look closely at the "0".
3.  **Check Q7:** Did you capture the "77" grouping and the trailing "9"?
4.  **Format:** Is `question_number` an integer? Is the list sorted 1-10?

Respond in the following JSON format, providing a list of all questions and their answers:
