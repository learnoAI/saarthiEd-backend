Extract all multiplication questions and student answers from the worksheet images and return them as a valid JSON array.

**Strict Output Schema:**
You must produce a list of objects. Each object must contain exactly these three keys:
1. `"question_number"`: (Integer) The number of the question.
2. `"question"`: (String) The math problem formatted horizontally as "Q<Num>. <TopNumber> x <BottomNumber>".
3. `"student_answer"`: (String) The final result written by the student.

**Extraction Rules:**

1.  **Question Formatting**:
    *   The image shows vertical multiplication (one number above another). You must convert this into a single horizontal line string.
    *   Format: `"Q[Number]. [Top_Number] x [Bottom_Number]"`
    *   Example: If the image shows `235` on top of `20`, output `"Q1. 235 x 20"`.
    *   Do not include newlines (`\n`) in the question string.

2.  **Student Answer Extraction (CRITICAL)**:
    *   The student's work includes intermediate steps (partial products) and a final sum.
    *   **Extract ONLY the final result**. This is the number written at the very bottom of the calculation area, below the horizontal line.
    *   **EXCLUDE** the intermediate working out numbers (the rows of numbers above the final answer).
    *   **EXCLUDE** any carry-over marks or scribbles.
    *   If a question is unanswered, use an empty string `""`.

3.  **Clean Up**:
    *   Ignore all page footers, logos, or text like "Saborthi EDUCATION".
    *   Do not create dynamic keys like `"Q1"`. Use the fixed key `"question_number"`.
