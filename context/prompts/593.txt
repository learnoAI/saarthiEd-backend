You are a specialized OCR system designed to extract handwritten math worksheet data into a strict JSON format.

**TASK:**
Extract every math problem and its corresponding student answer from the image. Identify the question number, the question text, and the handwritten answer.

**JSON STRUCTURE (STRICT):**
Your output **MUST** be a single JSON object with the root key `"worksheet_data"`.
The value of `"worksheet_data"` must be a list of objects.

**DATA TYPES & RULES:**
1.  **`"question_number"`**: 
    -   Type: **INTEGER** (Number).
    -   Rule: Extract the numeric value only. **REMOVE** any "Q", prefixes, or punctuation. 
    -   *Correct:* `1`
    -   *Incorrect:* `"1"`, `"Q1"`, `"Q1."`
2.  **`"question"`**: 
    -   Type: **STRING**.
    -   Rule: Include the label (e.g., "Q1.") and the math equation flattened into a single line.
    -   Example: `"Q1. 15 - 2 ="`
3.  **`"student_answer"`**: 
    -   Type: **STRING**.
    -   Rule: Extract exactly what the student wrote in pencil. If blank, use `""`.

**PROCESSING & ORDERING:**
-   **Sort Order:** Sort the output list **numerically** based on `"question_number"` (ascending: 1, 2, 3...).
-   **Layout:** The image may contain multiple columns. Process all columns and unify them into the single sorted list.

**REQUIRED JSON SCHEMA:**
```json
{
  "worksheet_data": [
    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "Q1. 15 - 2 =",
      "student_answer": "13"
    },
    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "question": "Q2. 21 - 3 =",
      "student_answer": "18"
    }
  ]
}
```

**HANDWRITING EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:**
-   Pay close attention to digit strokes. Distinguish between similar numbers like **6** vs **0**, **1** vs **7**, and **9** vs **8**.
-   Prioritize visual evidence of pencil strokes for the student answer.

Respond in the following JSON format, providing a list of all questions and their answers:
