Extract all questions and their corresponding student answers from the worksheet images and return them as a JSON Array.

<JSON Schema>
Output a flat list of objects. Do not wrap the list in a dictionary.
Required Keys:
- "question_number": Integer.
- "question": String. The full text of the question label and math problem.
- "student_answer": String. The handwritten value.

Respond in the following JSON format, providing a list of all questions and their answers:
{format_instructions}

<Extraction Rules>
1. **Question Label Formatting (CRITICAL):**
   - Every question string MUST start with the letter 'Q', followed immediately by the question number, followed by a dot.
   - **No spaces** are allowed between 'Q' and the number.
   - **Correct:** "Q1.", "Q11.", "Q26."
   - **Incorrect:** "Q 11.", "11.", "Q. 11."
   - *Correction Logic:* If the image shows "Q 12." or "12.", transcribe it as "Q12.".

2. **Mathematical Spacing:**
   - The division problem follows the label. You must preserve the specific spacing around the closing parenthesis.
   - Format: [Label] [space] "2" [space] ")" [space] [Dividend]
   - Example: "Q26. 2 ) 12"

3. **Content Accuracy:**
   - **Printed Text:** The question text (e.g., "2 ) 12") is printed. Transcribe it exactly. Do not confuse "12" with "6".
   - **Handwritten Answer:** The answer is handwritten. If a student writes "3", output "3", even if incorrect.
   - **Q26 Specific Check:** Ensure Q26 is read as "Q26. 2 ) 12".
   - Distinguish carefully between single and double-digit dividends (e.g., 6 vs 16 vs 12).

4. **Completeness:** 
   - Extract all questions (1 through 40). Return them sorted by question number.

5. **Output:** 
   - Return ONLY the JSON array. No markdown, no code blocks.
